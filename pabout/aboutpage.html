            <h2>EARLY YEARS</h2>
            <p>
                From an early age I believed in giving my all to every thing I did.
                I began aquiring many different skills. 
                Such as drumming, playing football and performing in stage plays.
                I then adapted a love for computers when I began making a Myspace page and
                using limewire to get songs.
            </p>
                I did become an avid gamer and enjoy slipping away into the alternate worlds
                game development is something that has crossed my mind and I could see myself
                branching out into that style of programming.
            <p>

            <h2>HOBBIES</h2>
            <p>
                I really enjoy playing the drums, I miss playing them and plan on filling
                that void sometime soon.
                I dabble in creative writting and have a small collection of incomplete works
                that desperately require further attention.
                I like doing almot anything with my hands, general crafting, cooking, gardening
                if I had the space.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was in a thrash power metal band for a few years and miss it dearly, the weekend
                gigs were some of the more memorable experiences of my life.
                I also have done plenty of stage acting, starting at a young age.
            </P>

            <h2>WHERE I SEE MYSELF IN TEN YEARS</h2>
            <p>
                I see myself either happy and coding for a company, earning a comfortable living,
                maybe catching a break with one of my scripts or as an actor. But wherever I am in ten
                years, it will all have been for my son and future family.
